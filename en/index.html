                <h3>Accelerating brain <br>
                    research in Canada</h3>
                <p>High-impact research in the neurosciences requires access to shared equipment, facilities, services, databases, computing/ informatics facilities, patient repositories, and biobanks; collectively referred to as “platforms”.</p>

                <p>Such platforms are complex, highly sophisticated, and expensive, but are now recognized as important capacity- builders and a cost-effective means to make cutting-edge resources and services available widely—beyond what any researcher could develop on their own.</p>
                    
                <p>Platforms also play a critical role in fostering innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. As such, access to platforms is essential to address the evolving needs of research.</p>
                    
                <p>This year’s case studies capture the impact of Platform Support Grants (PSG) by illustrating the way they benefit the research community in Canada and globally to drive discovery. Our cohort of focus includes grants that are now complete, awarded in 2014 and 2015 for approximately four years in duration.</p>

                        <h6>Hungry Messengers</h6>
                        <p>When you fill your stomach with a piece of chocolate cake, your brain receives a signal for that fullness and tells your body to start metabolizing. Thankfully, this signalling isn’t the result of the sugars or fats from the cake flooding your brain; these molecules could do harm to your central nervous system, so the protective blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents them from making that crossing. The signal for fullness is transmitted via specialized brain cells called tanycytes that cross the BBB and act as important messengers between the body and the brain.</p>

                        <h6>Identifying the Cause</h6>
                        <p>McGill University’s Dr. Masha Prager-Khoutorsky is an expert on tanycyte cells, studying their link to conditions such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Using a 2019 Azrieli Future Leader in Canadian Brain Research Grant, Dr. Prager-Khoutorsky identified a strong influencer of tanycyte cells’ ability to communicate signals of fullness to the brain – circadian rhythm.</p>


                        <p class="study__quote">“The Future Leader Grant allowed me to develop this new direction in the lab. It’s a prestigious award that definitely helped me as a new investigator. The cohorts of Future Leaders are truly the future of neuroscience!”</p>

                        <p>Dr. Masha Prager-Khoutorsky</p>

                        <h6>Missing Signals</h6>
                        <p>As Dr. Prager-Khoutorsky explains, when tanycytes malfunction and can’t do their job, for example when they’re unable to sense leptin, the hormone that gets released into the blood when we eat, the brain doesn’t get the signal it needs to control metabolism. In other words, the brain doesn’t receive a signal of fullness from the body. In the case of obesity, the result is more calories being storedas fat.</p>
                        <p>Changes to our circadian rhythms may be one of the reasons behind increased rates of obesity.</p>

                        <h6>Disrupted Rhythms</h6>
                        <p>“Yes, we’re eating different foods and that plays a role. But we’ve also experienced significant changes to our circadian rhythms over the last many years. For example, we’re exposed to light for far longer periods of time, and this affects circadian rhythm, which thereby affects metabolism,” says Dr. Prager-Khoutorsky.</p>

                        <h6>Communication Between Cells, and Nations</h6>
                        <p>With an additional $1.5 million in funding through the competitive Joint Canada-Israel Health Research Program, Dr. Prager-Khoutorsky is building on her Brain Canada-funded work to explore yet another factor that influences the ability of tanycytes to communicate between the body and the brain – neuroinflammation caused by bacterial infections. This new project builds on an existing collaboration with Dr. Ruud Buijs based at Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and includes a new collaborator in Dr. Yoav Livneh from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">A strain of probiotic will soon be tested as a potential treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The clinical study is taking place thanks to a $1.6 million investment by the Weston Family Foundation – critical funding that builds on a series of Discovery Grants from ALS Canada and Brain Canada.</p>
                        <h6>Drug-Free Treatment</h6>
                        <p>“This trial has received a lot of interest from people around the world. And I completely understand why – ALS is a devastating, incurable disease,” explains Dr. Alex Parker, lead investigator and neuroscientist based at the CHUM Research Centre (CRCHUM) in Montreal. “Probiotics are well known. And they’re not drugs, so the risk of side effects is minimal.”</p>
                        <h6>Benevolent Bacteria</h6>
                        <p>Dr. Parker and his team use animal models to better understand – and ultimately find solutions for – diseases like ALS. Driven by trainee turned research associate Dr. Audrey Labarre, who recently received a Mitacs Accelerate internship to support her work, they discovered that a specific probiotic bacteria called Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus HA-114 protects motor neurons—the nerve cells that wire the brain and control muscular movement— a worm model of ALS.</p>
                        <p>With a 2021 ALS Canada - Brain Canada Discovery Grant, Dr. Parker and his team confirmed that the same protective effect occurs with a more complex animal model, the mouse.</p>
                        <p class="study__quote">“Other funders just didn’t quite get what we were doing at the time.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. Alex Parker</p>
                        <h6>Boosting Protective Lipids</h6>
                        <p>Using genetic, behavioural, and imaging analyses, the team identified that lipid metabolism – and specifically the process of beta-oxidation that breaks lipids down into energy in the body’s cells – is impaired in ALS, and restored with the probiotic. They believe that the HA-114 probiotic achieves this restoration by supplying lipids to the energy powerhouse of the cell, the mitochondria. The boosted lipid supply rebalances energy metabolism in ALS and leads to a decrease in neurodegeneration.</p>
                        <p>“This work has been supported by ALS Canada and Brain Canada Discovery Grants all along at different stages. Other funders just didn’t quite get what we were doing at the time,” says Dr. Parker.</p>
                        <h6>Human Trials Underway</h6>
                        <p>The clinical study of the HA-114 probiotic will involve 100 Canadian participants. Using serum and blood samples, the team will study the lipids and microbiomes of participants before and after treatment with the probiotic. Comparing healthy people and those with ALS will allow the team to better understand the lipid profile of ALS patients. It will also allow them to determine whether the restorative effects they’ve seen in worm and mouse models are possible in humans.</p>

                        <p>His research was made possible thanks to funding from Brain Canada, through a 2015 Multi-Investigator Research Initiative (MIRI) Team Grant.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Better Diagnosis for Better Treatment</h6>
                        <p>“This funding from Brain Canada was critical in allowing us to identify brain imaging and blood markers for an understudied cause of cognitive decline called cerebral amyloid angiopathy,” says Dr. Smith. “It allowed us to shine a light on less common contributors to dementia that are now more important than ever to consider when we think about individualized treatment options.”</p>
                        
                        <h6>Helping Patients, and Family Doctors</h6> 
                        <p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or CAA, accounts for 7% of dementia risk and 20% of all hemorrhagic strokes. It is considered a sister disease of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) but one that is not well known to the general public or family physicians as it is often difficult to distinguish from other causes of cognitive decline.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class="study__quote">“I am grateful to Brain Canada for recognizing the need to look at complimentary and novel approaches to better understand cognitive decline in a way that allows us to look beyond Alzheimer’s disease in a silo.”</p>

                        <p>To better understand the commonalities and distinctions between these two diseases, Dr. Smith and collaborators sought to identify markers for CAA in biofluids and brain images.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Pioneering a Whole New Technique</h6>
                        <p>They discovered a new test that can detect beta-amyloid in the blood using white blood cells that ingest beta- amyloid in their journey through our bodies’ blood vessels.</p>
                        
                        <p>Dr. Peter Stys from the University of Calgary, working with Dr. Smith and his colleagues, developed a technique called AmiraSpecTM that uses highly sensitive probes in blood samples to detect aggregates of beta-amyloid ingested by white blood cells. With leveraged funding from the Weston Brain Institute and a new collaboration with McGill University, Dr. Stys and Dr. Smith are expanding this work. The AmiraSpecTM technology, which has been patented, is now being developed for a broader range of other diseases that are characterized by misfolded proteins, including Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Discovery upon Discovery</h6>
                        <p>Another discovery showed that measuring injury to the brain’s white matter, the reduced ability of brain regions to receive higher blood flow when needed, and brain shrinkage are important imaging markers of CAA in the brain. A recent study by Dr. Smith and colleagues showed that these markers account for 50% of the effect CAA has on cognition.</p>

                        <p>Brain imaging expert Dr. Catherine Lebel at the University of Calgary has published a first-of-its-kind study focused on youth at risk of serious mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. The study is part of a larger 2014 Multi-Investigator Research Initiative (MIRI) led by psychiatrist Dr. Jean Addington at the University of Calgary and funded by Brain Canada and the Hotchkiss Brain Institute.</p>
                        <p>“We wanted to figure out – who’s going to need support? And can we get them that support early?” explains Dr. Lebel.</p>
                        <h6>All Types of Young Brains</h6>
                        <p>The first step of the project classified youth based on clinical assessments of their risk for serious mental illness and their symptoms. Groups included: healthy controls with no personal or family history of mental illness, people who were healthy but carried a familial risk, people with mild symptoms, people experiencing more significant symptoms but without a diagnosis, and people who received a diagnosis during the study.</p>
                        <p>The team then collected brain imaging data from these five distinct groups of youth at baseline and after one year todetermine whether the brain showed signs of transition to serious mental illness.</p>
                        <p class="study__quote">“If you can predict who will transition and develop serious mental illness, you can intervene earlier and maybe prevent it in the ideal circumstance.”</p>

                        <h6>Seeing Brain Connections</h6>
                        <p>Dr. Lebel and her team used the imaging data to generate “connectomes”, which are essentially maps that illustrate how the brain is functioning as a network. The connectomes map the imaging data for both structural connectivity, which is how white matter is connected within the brain, and functional connectivity, which is how different areas of the brain work together. Using a machine learning model, the team then sought to confirm whether any brain features were distinct across the five categories of youth.</p>
                        
                        <p>“We looked at the question in a number of ways and we didn’t find any major brain differences between youth who do and youth who don’t yet have – but are at risk for – a serious mental illness,” explains Dr. Lebel. “Maybe there are no differences to be found. But there is still a lot to be learned from an experiment like this.”</p>
                        
                        <h6>Full Spectrum Approach</h6>
                        <p>This approach could serve as a new framework for future studies seeking to predict serious mental illness. Studies of this kind often look at one illness at a time, but Dr. Lebel and her team looked at the full spectrum of mental illness. This choice reflects increasing consensus in the scientific community that in their early stages, serious mental illnesses are often indistinguishable from one another.</p>

                        <h6>Some Genes Put Kids at Higher Risk</h6>

                        <p>Dr. Sébastien Jacquemont was awarded a 2015 Brain Canada Multi-Investigator Research Initiative (MIRI) Team Grant. A medical geneticist and researcher, Dr. Jacquemont seeks to understand why certain genetic profiles put children at a higher risk for autism, schizophrenia, or other neuropsychiatric conditions. This knowledge is key to establishing early interventions and developing tailored therapies.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Creating a Better Test Group</h6>
                        <p>Dr. Jacquemont observed that existing datasets of cognitive, behavioural, and brain measures lacked children with mutations associated with a high risk for neurodevelopmental conditions, who he was often seeing in the clinic. He wanted to develop a cohort of families carrying different genetic mutations associated with these conditions so he could test whether different mutations affecting the same biological function would lead to similar neuropsychiatric symptoms.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Go Big. Go Bold.</h6>
                        <p>Dr. Jacquemont and his team saw value in studying the whole array of mutations at once to assess their influence on the brain and behaviour characteristics. A decade ago, this was a very bold idea. “’Why would you do that?’ I was asked. ‘It’s not going to work. Why not continue to study one mutation at a time?’,” recounts Dr. Jacquemont.</p>
                        
                        <h6>Brain Canada Gets It</h6>
                        <p>Dr. Jacquemont asserts that most funding agencies would not have supported this project. But Brain Canada saw value in Dr. Jacquemont’s approach, and in the team that he assembled to pursue it, including autism expert Dr. Mayada Elsabbagh, neuropsychologist Dr. Sarah Lippé,
                        and neuroimaging expert Dr. Alan Evans, to name a few. The team recruited 400 families to participate in their Brain Canada-funded study and after four years, was able
                        to demonstrate significant correlations between certain genetic mutations and functional connectivity in the brain.</p>
                        
                        <p>“With many of these same co-investigators, we’ve now turned our Team Grant into a much larger project – Q1K (Québec 1000 Families), which is the largest clinically integrated autism research project in the province of Quebec and one of the largest in the world,” explains Dr. Jacquemont. Q1K received $10 million in philanthropic funding from Fondation Marcelle et Jean Coutu.</p>
                        
                        
                        <p class="study__quote">“Thanks to Brain Canada investment, we’re officially liberated from the idea of studying one gene at a time.”</p>

                        <h6>Research Momentum Is Growing</h6>
                        <p>Dr. Jacquemont was also recently awarded a $2.5 million grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to continue his bold approach of studying ecosystems of genes based on their contributions to brain function and behaviour in neuropsychiatric conditions. “There’s no way we would have been able to get the NIH grant if it wasn’t for the preliminary findings of our Brain Canada Team Grant – the hypothesis might have been interesting, but without the preliminary data it simply would not have been funded,” says Dr. Jacquemont.</p>
                        
                        <p>Data from Dr. Jacquemont’s project is now shared through the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium, a network of more than 2,500 scientists from around the world.</p>

                        <h6>Interconnected Diseases</h6>
                        <p>Cerebrovascular disease, specifically small vessel disease (SVD), is a prominent risk factor for Alzheimer’s and other dementias. It damages the cerebral white matter, and it contributes to shrinkage in certain areas of the brain. In turn, Alzheimer’s can cause SVD by contributing to the accumulation of a protein called beta-amyloid in the brain’s blood vessels. The damage caused by these brain conditions together affects overall brain function and cognitive decline in aging individuals.</p>
                        <p>Identifying treatment options targeted to individuals with cerebrovascular disease as an Alzheimer’s risk factor requires a better understanding of the biological processes involved.</p>
                        <h6>Identifying the Genes</h6>
                        <p>Tackling this challenge is precisely what Dr. Walter Swardfager from the University of Toronto and Sunnybrook Research Institute set out to accomplish with his International Research Grant Program (IRGP) Alzheimer’s Association Research Grant (AARG), co-funded by the Alzheimer’s Association and Brain Canada. With this funding support, Dr. Swardfager was able to identify genomic variants that, in the presence of SVD, increase shrinking of the brain.</p>

                        <h6>Targeting a Rogue Enzyme</h6>
                        <p>In their preliminary explorations, Dr. Swardfager and his team discovered that variations in a gene called EPHX2 were linked to damage to the brain’s white matter. Single nucleotide polymorphisms, or genetic variations, in the EPHX2 gene affected the volume of brain shrinkage in the presence of SVD across various neurodegenerative diagnoses. This discovery suggests that the enzyme produced by the EPHX2 gene might be targeted to protect against SVD-related brain changes and cognitive decline in individuals with or at risk for Alzheimer’s.</p>
                        <p class="study__quote">“We’re now submitting and receiving grants that build on the science in this area and may take us all the way to clinical trials. It’s been tremendous.”</p>
                        <p>Dr. Walter Swardfager</p>
                        <p>Because of this finding and with leveraged funding from his AARG, Dr. Swardfager’s team went on to show that the products of the EPHX2 enzyme were elevated in the blood of people with SVD. Based on this evidence, Dr. Swardfager prepares to soon test whether inhibiting the enzyme encoded by EPHX2 prevents SVD-related cognitive impairments clinically. He hopes that the approach might ultimately prevent or slow progression to dementia.</p>
                        <h6>Fostering a Talent Pipeline</h6>
                        <p>“Establishing this dataset has increased the productivity of my lab and provided training opportunities to 18 undergraduate and graduate students,” says Dr. Swardfager. “We’re now submitting and receiving grants that build on the science in this area and may take us all the way to clinical trials. It’s been tremendous.”</p>
                        <p>Funded in 2017, two years into his assistant professorship in the Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology at the University of Toronto, this grant contributed significantly to growing Dr. Swardfager’s academic career and lab.</p>
                        <p>“Grants like the AARG that support early-career researchers, and seed funding from organizations like BrainCanada and the Alzheimer’s Association, are essential. This was the first international research grant I received. I cannot overstate the importance of this funding and the number of doors it has opened for my trainees and for me,” shares Dr. Swardfager, who is now a Canada Research Chair.</p>
